# MasterTerrainDiffusion

## Master Thesis Project

This project involved training a diffusion model on a custom dataset created using Perlin Noise and Ridge Noise.

This repository contains files used to progress the project, with "FinalDiffusionTraining.py" was used to train the final diffusion model that generated the results

The folders in the repository contain the results from the diffusion model (samples and PSD), results from random noise (samples and PSD), and the PSD from the dataset in addition to some examples from the dataset (not full 15000 images since its too large).
